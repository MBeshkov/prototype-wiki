My favourite spot in the city must be Shakes and Cakes in Old Aberdeen. For one, it’s one of the (probably) three buildings that have actual colour in them. That is something noteworthy in its own right. Of course, that is not its main attraction. No one goes there for the architecture, it is the bloody good waffles that seal the deal! Even an Uncle Scrooge like me doesn’t hesitate to splurge for ‘just one more’ of their wonderful desserts. It is such a cozy place that encourages you to just melt in your spot together with the ice cream in your plate. Once you are all warmed up, take your friend by the hand and lead them on an adventure along the misty cobbled streets. You might uncover some very intriguing secrets between the narrow alleys, shadowy buildings and delicate flower gardens. A friendly tip: do that at night. It is just as romantic as it is spooky. With Halloween approaching, you might also want to consider putting on your ghost cape and scaring as much innocent passers-by as you can. Just don’t tell them I gave you the idea.
